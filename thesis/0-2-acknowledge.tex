\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\label{C:ack}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Bastiaan Kleijn, for his guidance and support throughout this project, and my co-supervisor Dr. JP. Lewis for providing me the research direction. I would like to thank the effective altruism community for motivating me to pursue deep learning -- I hope I can contribute to the project of AI alignment in future. Lastly, I would like to thank my friends and family for their support and encouragement, and especially my girlfriend Kibra for her patience and understanding.
