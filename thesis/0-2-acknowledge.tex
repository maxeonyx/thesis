\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\label{C:ack}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Bastiaan Kleijn, for his guidance and support throughout this project, and my co-supervisor Dr. JP. Lewis for providing me with the hand motion research direction. I would like to thank the effective altruism community for motivating me to pursue deep learning -- there may not be a more pressing problem today than that of AI alignment. I hope I can use what I have learned from this Master's to contribute to ensuring future AI systems do not cause the great harms they will likely be capable of. Lastly, I would like to thank my friends and family for their support and encouragement, and especially Kibra for her patience and understanding.
