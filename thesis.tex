\title{Conditional Generative Transformers for Hand-Guided Animation Automation}
\author{Maxwell Clarke}

\subject{Computer Science}
\abstract{
In this thesis I develop neural networks and apply them to the problem of hand motion modelling for film production.

Firstly, I develop a novel training regime for transformers which allows auto-regressive sampling of high-dimensional data in an arbitrary order, and demonstrate this technique on pixel-by-pixel sampling of MNIST images.

Secondly, I develop a predictive model for hand-motion data, via unsupervised training on a motion-capture dataset. I compare fixed-order sampling to best order I found using the above technique.
